My favorite lesson I have learned at Rockit Bootcamp has been anything concerning git and GitHub. I find version control to be pretty awesome and enormously useful.

While git can be pretty daunting to learn on your own, and I struggled with it at first, it is actually quite simple when it is gradually explained to you. Once you get used to it, there is no living without it.

This third paragraph is just because Brig said we had to have three paragrphs.
